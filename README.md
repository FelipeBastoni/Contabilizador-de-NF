Used Pandas and PyMuPDF

If you re-use it you may find some troubles in this version due to the lenght of the product description, and the comparison parameter "789".
I recommend that the description length don't pass one string.
For the comparasson parameter you can jus add more if's or numbers to the comparison, I still want to solve this in an more professional way.
I will probably make the comparison parameter value come from the spreadsheet.
