I used Pandas and PyMuPDF to write on the xlsx and read the PDF

If you re-use it you may find some troubles in this version due to the lenght of the product description, and the comparison parameter "789".
(i have made some updates since then, but it may still present troubles).
I recommend that the description length don't pass one string.

I was thinking of make the comparison parameter value come from the spreadsheet, maybe I will add this in the future.
