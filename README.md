I used Pandas and PyMuPDF to write on the xlsx and read the PDF

If you re-use it you may find some troubles in this version due to the lenght of the product description, and the comparison parameter "789".
(i have made some modifications since then but it may still present this troubles)
I recommend that the description length don't pass one string.
For the comparasson parameter you can jus add more if's or numbers to the comparison, I still want to solve this in an more professional way.
I was thinking of make the comparison parameter value come from the spreadsheet.
